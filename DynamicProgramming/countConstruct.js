/*
  Write a function countConstruct that takes in a target string and an array of strings (word bank) as arguments.
  The function should return the number of ways that the target string can be constructed by concatenating elements from the word bank array.
  You may reuse elements of the word bank array as many times as needed.

  countConstruct('abcdef', ['ab', 'abc', 'cd', 'def', 'abcd']) => 1
  countConstruct('skateboard', ['bo', 'rd', 'ate', 't', 'ska', 'sk', 'boar']) => 0
  countConstruct('purple',['purp','p','ur','le','purpl']) => 2
